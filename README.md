### Hi there! 👋

My programming journey began in high school when I became interested in creating computer games. My first projects were developed in the Unity engine using C#, which has since become my main tool. Nowadays, I primarily use it for building web application backends, as well as professionally – in my role as a Junior Software Developer – for creating desktop applications.

I’m interested in building an application using a modular monolith architecture with Domain-Driven Design (DDD). From what I understand, this is currently one of the best approaches for developing large-scale projects.

As part of my engineering thesis, I developed a simple project management application, available at: https://planmate.pl/.
While working on it, I followed the SSDLC (Secure Software Development Life Cycle) approach, which emphasizes security aspects at every stage of the software development process. In practice, this included implementing unit, integration, and penetration tests, as well as integrating continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) as core parts of the development pipeline.

The project was built using the following technologies:
- PostgreSQL as the database system
- .NET 8 for backend development
- Angular for the user interface
- Docker for containerizing the database, frontend, and backend, and for deploying the entire application

Additionally, over the past few years, I have created several mobile games in Unity, which are available on Google Play:
- [Space Defense: Galaxy Harvest](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.SpaceDefence.GalaxyHarvest)
- [Super Bomber Classic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.bomberman.classic)
- [Dethrone the King
](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.GameLab.DethronetheKing)
I also hold a Cambridge B2 English Certificate, which confirms my strong command of the English language and enables me to work effectively in international environments.
